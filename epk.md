The arrangements on their debut EP ‘Sail’, which was released in July 2019, are not only accompanied by the three-piece band but also enriched with romantic strings, unusual, unique background vocals and a few well-chosen electronic elements. In addition, rhythmic delay guitars that remind of U2 gleam through, which, together with bass, piano and drums, create a soft and heavenly space in which Julia’s classically trained vocals are able to unfold to their fullest. The melodies immediately get under your skin and stick in your mind. Julia’s Mind takes you on a dreamily musical journey as their music has something especially floating, epic and emotional about itself, which immediately picks up fans of Florence + the Machine, AURORA or King Princess.

On stage Julia mutates into an energy bundle full of joy and passion and is able to transfer her spirit to everyone in the room within few minutes - which is why everyone leaves a Julia’s Mind show with a broad smile on their faces.

Julia and her three band members don’t reinvent the wheel, but much more point out what is going wrong in the current charts – and how you can still create fresh and great pop music with a conventional band line-up. Since 2016, they have been able to gain a loyal and constantly growing audience by playing local festivals and club shows. In 2019, the band debuted with their EP ‘Sail’, including the eponymous lead-single as well as “The Great Collapse”.
