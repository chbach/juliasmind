I"ó<p>The arrangements on their debut EP â€˜Sailâ€™, which was released in July 2019, are not only accompanied by the three-piece band but also enriched with romantic strings, unusual, unique background vocals and a few well-chosen electronic elements. In addition, rhythmic delay guitars that remind of U2 gleam through, which, together with bass, piano and drums, create a soft and heavenly space in which Juliaâ€™s classically trained vocals are able to unfold to their fullest. The melodies immediately get under your skin and stick in your mind. Juliaâ€™s Mind takes you on a dreamily musical journey as their music has something especially floating, epic and emotional about itself, which immediately picks up fans of Florence + the Machine, AURORA or King Princess.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>On stage Julia mutates into an energy bundle full of joy and passion and is able
to transfer her spirit to everyone in the room within few minutes - which is why everyone leaves a Juliaâ€™s Mind show with a broad smile on their faces.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Julia and her three band members donâ€™t reinvent the wheel, but much more point out what is going wrong in the current charts â€“ and how you can still create fresh and great pop music with a conventional band line-up. Since 2016, they have been able to gain a loyal and constantly growing audience by playing local festivals and club shows. In 2019, the band debuted with their EP â€˜Sailâ€™, including the eponymous lead-single as well as â€œThe Great Collapseâ€.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
